<h1>Main Heading</h1>
<h3>H1 | Anamatic SC | 36px</h3>
<br>

<h2>This is my font selection. I chose Anamatic SC for the main headings to create a sense of Goofiness, friendliness, fun, and creativity, and the Arapey typeface to give a more stable feel to the information layer.
i chose to be unpraticial and traditional. its a beauty we in the company all love to demonstrate to our clients. we are not robots. </h2>
<h3>H2 | Arapey, | 14px</h3>
<br>

<p>The Unica One typeface was inspired by the old posters and signs in the traditional neighborhood art from the nieghborhood. i want to give the feeling of familiarization into my website i want people to feel as if they had participation into the design.
for that reason i chose Unica One typeface to demonstrate information. </p>
<h3>P | Unica One | 14px</h3>
